amazon-q-football-pong,Amazon Q Football Pong,Kurnic,"Inspired (but not enough to follow the rules) by AWS Build Games Challenge:https://builder.aws.com/content/2y6egGcPAGQs8EwtQUM9KAONojz/build-games-challeng...Decided to check what I could achieve quickly with Amazon Q assistance.After setting everything up, I set a 1hour timer and this game is the result. Besides writing two lines to load phaser (https://phaser.io/), I did not code anything else as I only used Amazon Qs chat and some free online assets:https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/soccer-ball-kick-37625/https://pixabay.com/es/sound-effects/11l-victory-sound-with-t-1749487402950-3576...https://pixabay.com/es/sound-effects/11l-victory-sound-with-t-1749487052579-3576...https://pixabay.com/es/sound-effects/11l-victory-sound-with-t-1749487409696-3576...https://pixabay.com/es/sound-effects/11l-victory-sound-with-t-1749487045383-3576...https://pixabay.com/es/sound-effects/11l-victory-sound-with-t-1749487415737-3576...https://opengameart.org/content/seamless-grass-texture-iiThe kind of messages I had to use on the chat are as following:-Change the instructions to a different font color (the background is green), put them in a better position under the score and make the instructions dissapear once the players have pressed all directions at least once-Make the screen shake a bit when a paddle touches the ball.Make the screen shake a lot when a player scores.-Wait 1 second before making the ball kick off at the beginning and 0,5 after each goal-The ball is moving during the delay periods, please check and fix the bugIf you download the zip file, you'll find a q-dev-chat.md with all the chat conversation.",,Sports,Free,6 minutes ago,Unknown,No rating,Unknown,,https://kurnic.itch.io/amazon-q-football-pong,,2025-07-15

trouble-in-the-wild-wild-west,Trouble in The Wild Wild West,glomper,"This is my first game project in C# and Unity. It's meant to be very difficult. There is a level selector on the main menu to select any level you want. Obviously this game is very much unfinished and is only a very early prototype. I'm just looking for feedback on what I have so far. Assets have been borrowed fromhttps://www.spriters-resource.com/andhttps://opengameart.org/. Some sprites were done by hand and other images such as backgrounds were done via AI. AI was also used to help answer questions about coding throughout the project and cleanup code as I produced the game. It's an indispensable tool for new and learning programmers and content creators.CONTROLS:Arrow Keys/WASD = MoveZ/, = Jumpx/. = Shootesc = Main Menulevels 6/7 you can hold shift to run",,Platformer,Free,11 minutes ago,Unknown,No rating,Unknown,,https://glomper.itch.io/trouble-in-the-wild-wild-west,,2025-07-15
